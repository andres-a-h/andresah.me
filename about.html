        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I'm Andres Hernandez and I'm a 2nd year student at Dartmouth College. I am planning on studying computer engineering and am interested in subjects like robotics, software development, and humanitarian engineering projects. On campus, I am part of the Dartmouth Humanitarian Engineering Club and am currently working on The Cot Project. We are working with Upper Valley Haven to engineer more durable and supportive cots for them to use in their shelter during the winter.

          I was born in Bakersfield, CA, raised in McFarland, CA (yes like the Disney movie), and now live in Hanover, NH. I really enjoy coding and UI development because it allows me to apply all the information and concepts I have learned from a classroom or on my own. Perhaps the thing I lose most about it is the enormous sense of accomplishment when a project is completed (like this website). My hobbies include playing video games (either on PC or PS4), going to the gym, drawing, watching movies, and looking for new music to listen to. Fun fact: I am actually really good at video games and have won money from playing and winning in tournaments. I am also a huge nerd for PC hardware and have built my own PC. I am currently working on building a new PC and am really excited about that.

          My parents are both from Durango, Mexico and did not have the opportunity to finish their education past high school. I am the first in my family to go to college, so I have the opportunity my parents did not, and that is a motivating factor in my studies. I am fluent in English , Spanish, and started learning French in college (I only have basic speaking and reading skills). In the future, I hope to have a career in the tech industry that allows me to work for either a more sustainable and eco-friendly future or that allows me to directly assist communities in need.

          In the first picture, you can see me and some friends bowling. It is really hard to tell, but I am actually winning the game and flexing my bowling muscles. I don't bowl often, but I really do enjoy doing it with friends.

          In the second picture, you can see me and my ENGS 21 group sitting on our different iterations of our product. We ended up with five different iterations, one for each of us. The class itself was a fantastic learning experience and taught me many valuable all around engineering skills.

          In the third picture, you can see me and couple members of the Dartmouth Humanitarian Engineering Club filing down some L-shaped steel bars for the cot we were constructing. During this Machine Shop session, I had drilled holes in the bars using a mill so that we could fit bolts through the bars. We then used the bandsaw to cut the bars at a 45 degree angle at their ends so they would fit together. Finally, we filed down the ends to smooth them out.
